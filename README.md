AT3 - Data Product with Machine Learning - 36120 Advanced Machine Learning Application - Spring 2023

Project Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to our collaborative project aiming to build a data product that empowers users in the USA to make accurate estimates of their local travel airfare. With our [Streamlit app](https://share.streamlit.io/-/auth/app?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fcrybaby-fareprediction.streamlit.app%2F), users can easily input trip details, and our application will predict the expected flight fare.

Key Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Streamlit app allows users to provide the following inputs:

- üõ´ Origin Airport: Specify your starting point.
- üõ¨ Destination Airport: Choose your final destination.
- üìÖ Departure Date: Set the date of your trip.
- ‚è≤Ô∏è Departure Time: Select the time of departure.
- üí∫ Cabin Type: Pick your preferred cabin class (e.g., coach, premium, etc.).

Model Diversity
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our group has developed a range of models, each student contributing their best effort. The following models are available for fare prediction:

- Linear Regression: A fundamental model for basic regression tasks.
- Ridge: Designed to mitigate multicollinearity and prevent overfitting.
- ElasticNetCV: A hybrid model combining L1 and L2 regularization techniques.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Ideal for capturing local patterns in the data.
- Gradient Boosting: An ensemble method that excels in capturing complex, nonlinear relationships.
- Decision Tree: A tree-based model for predictive analysis.
- XGBoost: A powerful gradient boosting framework.
- AdaBoost: An ensemble boosting technique.
- TensorFlow Decision Forests (TF-DF) with Keras: Leveraging TensorFlow's powerful decision forests.
- Keras and KerasTuner: Utilizing Keras for neural network-based modeling.
